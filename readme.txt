This IPython notebook was tested on Python 3.12 and above

Place the blog-gender-dataset.xlsx in the same directory as .ipynb file

Install Required libraries
Run the following command
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

(Required)
Run first code cell that imports necessary libraries and downloads nltk data

Run the second code cell that loads the data

Run the third code cell that cleans the data

(Optional)
Exploratory Data analysis cells can be run for visualization but are not mandatory

Baseline Implementation:
Classes and pipelines defined in baseline implementation are necessary for subsequent code cells
(Required)
Even if the classifiers on not trained, the classes must be run

(Novel Approach 1):
Flesch Reading Ease score based classification

(Novel Approach 2):
Sentiment Polarity Statistics based Classification

(Required)
Above novel approach cells must be run and then combined apporach cell must be run

(CV and Hyperparameter tuning)
Must be run after combined approach cell is run

Accuracy plots cell can be run for visualizaton

(Note)
Every cell can be run in order without skipping any cells for best results
